While using Expo's `Camera` component, I encountered an issue where the camera preview would freeze intermittently, especially under high CPU load or when other intensive operations were running concurrently.  This resulted in a non-responsive UI and a poor user experience. The problem was inconsistent; sometimes it worked flawlessly, other times it would freeze for several seconds before resuming.
