# Expo Camera Preview Freezing Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Expo's Camera component where the preview freezes intermittently under high CPU load. The bug is characterized by periods of unresponsiveness in the camera preview, leading to a degraded user experience.  The provided solution explores strategies to mitigate this issue, improving the app's performance and stability.

## Bug Description

The camera preview occasionally freezes for several seconds.  This is more likely to occur when other resource-intensive operations are running concurrently within the application.  The freezing behavior is inconsistent and unpredictable.  This issue impacts the usability of the app, creating a jarring and negative user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves investigating potential causes of the issue and implementing mitigation strategies such as optimizing the rendering process, offloading intensive operations to background threads, or using techniques like requestAnimationFrame for smoother animations to avoid resource contention.  This may involve refactoring the application's architecture and employing more efficient code practices.
